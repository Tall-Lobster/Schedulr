Schedulr is an accessible chat bot on Slack that can manipulate your Google calendar by getting rid of, moving, or scheduling breaks in between events depending on the answers which are given through various questions asked by the bot. Schedulr can also set reminders and display the overall calendar to see how the day looks.

Schedulr is still in the development process, however progress will be tracked with regular contributions to the repository.
